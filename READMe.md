I created this extension to save my CH course progress like this

![course-progress2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62597848/91647812-ba42b680-ea7c-11ea-8cdf-6e423b971db6.jpg)

but with the new video player the code has broken and I don't have time to fix it.
If you want to fix it feel free to checkout `testing.js`. It has the previous code which fetches the course progress from the local storage and shows
in the UI

It's a Spaghetti code so good luck fixing it.
